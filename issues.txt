1. kicking players doesn't work
2. there should be an options for whether cards should be rendered as symbols or images. Also, add a hide cards checkbutton that hides a player's hole cards.
3. the give money button does not work, it gives "error: player not found" even when the player is actually in the lobby and playing
4. when people are out of money, it still deals them cards and counts them as playing
